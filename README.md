## This questions are due next discussion section (Week6).

1. Describe the Biology of your project? (one paragraph max).  
    The biology of this project revolves around an infectious disease model. This model takes into account the susceptability, recovery rate, and individuals who get infected. The model basically states that as people the more people that are susceptable to a disease, the more people who will become affected and die and therefore the population number will decrease. 

2. Describe the kind of data that you think you will be handling (one paragraph max).  
  Our program will not necessariely handle any previous data, but instead, the program will generate data. We will allow the user to control three variables which include susceptability, infection, and recovery. The user will be able to simulate what would occur via an infectious disease model based on those three parameters. 

3. What would you like to do with that data? (one paragraph max).  
  I would like to allow the user of this program to be able to simulate what occurs via an infectious disease model based on the three parameters dicsussed above. This will hopefully help students when they are studying an infectious disease model in their classes.

4. What will be the output? (one paragraph max).  
  The output of this program/project will be a wesbite that contains the infectious disease model and the sliders that will correspond to the given parameters. The model will also have a graph that shows what happens when the user moves the values of the parameter. The website will also contain the equations that make the disease model valid. 

5. Is there any computational tool, package, etc. you would like to use? What would you do with that? For instance, you could mention shell scripts with `sed` or `awk` and will change the format of a table by replacing `,` with tabs. 
Also, you could mention tools that we havenâ€™t seen in class yet but you herd that may be useful for your project. 
For instance, you could say 
Irving and I will both use the R program and the shiny apps package that is in R to create the program and website for the infectious disease model. The user however, will only need to type in the url for the website that contains the infectious disease model and will be able to use it from their computer. 

6. What is your biggest concern regarding your project? (a few sentences max).
The biggest concern regarding our project is being able to use the shiny apps and understand the coding and how to edit the code to get the ouput we want for the infectious disease model.
